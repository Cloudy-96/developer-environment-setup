# Windows Setup Instructions

## Setting up Command Prompt

The Terminal is a program that developers use to run commands that tell the operating system (or another program), to perform specific tasks.

With the Terminal program we can install softwares that can be run from the terminal that perform really useful tasks for developers (such as creating an empty starter project, to running our project and so on).

## Install git & Git Bash

(PATH setup?)

## Install VSCode

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a code editor. It allows us to manage the files in a project and to edit the code that we write. It comes with a large number of very useful features that make development faster and easier. We can also improve its functionality by installing many extensions.

1. Visit [VSCode's download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. Download the Windows version
3. Once downloaded, open File Explorer and locate the file in the `Downloads` folder. You might need to double click on the `.zip` file in order to unzip the file and obtain the `Visual Studio Code.app`
4. Drag `Visual Studio Code.app` to your `Applications` folder.
5. Launch the application and pin the application to your launchbar, the same way as we did for the Terminal app.

Now follow the instructions for setting up the extensions for VS Code.
