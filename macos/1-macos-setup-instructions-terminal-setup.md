# Setting up Terminal.app

>The Terminal is a program that developers use to run commands that tell the operating system (or another program), to perform specific tasks.
With the Terminal program we can install softwares that can be run from the terminal that perform really useful tasks for developers (such as creating an empty starter project, to running our project and so on).

On macOS we can launch the terminal in the following ways.

**Option 1:** from spotlight search.

- Press `CMD+Space` on your keyboard
- In the search bar, type "Terminal"
- Press enter or click on the Terminal application

> _Note_ - in your Spotligh Search, `Terminal.app` might just be called `Terminal` without the `.app` at the end. It corresponds to the same program.

**Option 2:** from Launchpad

- Open Launchpad
- In the search bar, type "Terminal"
- Click to open the terminal app
