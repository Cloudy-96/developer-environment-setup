# 7. Change macOS Settings

Some macOS settings will make it hard to develop.

Open `System Preferences` (by clicking the apple logo at the top of your screen, for example, and finding the preferences).

In `System Preferences`, navigate to `Keyboard` and then choose the `Text` tab. You want to:

- Disable "Correct spelling automatically"
- Disable "Capitalize words automatically"
- Disable "Add period with double-space"
- Disable "Use smart quotes and dashes"

In `System Preferences`, navigate to `Security & Privacy` and then to the `General` tab. Make sure you allow downloads from "App Store and identified developers"

You may wish to have a [look at this guide](https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-a-brand-new-mac-for-development/), towards the end there are some other recommended settings and options that you can implement.
