# Windows Setup Instructions

## 2. Install VSCode

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a code editor. It allows us to manage the files in a project and to edit the code that we write. It comes with a large number of very useful features that make development faster and easier. We can also improve its functionality by installing many extensions.

1. Visit [VSCode's download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and select the `User Installer 64 bit` download - unless you have a `32 bit version of Windows`.
2. Once the download is complete, run it from your browser's download bar.
3. Launch VSCode and make sure to pin the software to the Taskbar for future access.

### 2.1 Install VSCode Extensions

Now follow the instructions for setting up the extensions for VS Code.
